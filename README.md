Hello!!

This is my first attempt at making a 2D top view game; I will be using the knowledge that I learned from "Python Crash Course 3rd Edition"
I covered the "Alien Invasion" that it had to offer. I would like to create some animations and usage of sprites in a more practical manner.
Hopefully as I continue to make commits to this game the progress will be seen. The hope is that after it is complete (or as close to playable as possible) this will contain instructions on how individuals can download and play the game!!
